## Introduction

This project was independently completed by me and is part of the Fuzhou University 202401 Software Engineering Practice team project.
Our group's project is to build a video creation and sharing platform called FuliFuli.
Since this is my first time using the Flutter framework and developing a complete app, the functionality of this project is relatively
simple, and some features are implemented very crudely.
It is normal to have no tests because I could only spend one or two weeks completing this program.
~~But I still tried my best to conquer it!~~

## Getting Started

You need to enter the following commands in the command line:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run ${platform}
```

However, since I only have Android devices, I have only tested it on Android devices, so I cannot guarantee it will run properly on other
platforms.

For Windows platforms, you can run the [build-by-splitting-abi.bat](build-by-splitting-abi.bat) script or
the [build-with-all-abi.bat](build-with-all-abi.bat) script in the root directory.
The above two scripts are used to build APKs for specific ABIs and build APKs for all ABIs, respectively.
