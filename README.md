## Introduction

This is a mobile application for FuliFuli, a platform for sharing and discovering beautiful things around the world.

This project is built with Flutter, a cross-platform mobile app development framework. It is designed to run on both Android and iOS
devices.

Now, we're in the early stage of development. We're working on the basic features of the app, such as user authentication, content sharing,
and content discovery.

## Feature

1. Internationalization: Support multiple languages.(Although we only have English and Chinese now, we will add more languages in the
   future.)
2. User Authentication: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out.
3. Content Sharing: Users can share beautiful things with others.
4. Content Discovery: Users can discover beautiful things shared by others.
5. Dark Mode: Support dark mode.
6. Responsive Design: Support different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
3. Run `flutter run` to start the app.
4. Enjoy!

## What's Next?

1. Implement the basic features of the app.
2. Add more features to the app.
3. Optimize the app for better performance.
4. Fix bugs and improve the user experience.
5. Test the app on different devices.
6. Release the app to the app stores.(However, we may not do this in the near future.)
